![Word cloud](/post/plotcon/wordcloud.png)

I gave a talk at [Plotcon](https://plotcon.plot.ly/) called "Beyond the word
cloud". It's about two things:

 - word clouds are bad
 - topic models and language embeddings are better

Here are [the slides and my notes](http://mike.place/talks/plotcon_2016/#p1).

It was a very high-level talk. If you'd like to go into more detail on how
topic models and language embeddings work, please see [the resources I linked
to](/2016/summarization/) for my talk on text summarization. In particular, you
may enjoy [my talk at PyGotham](https://youtu.be/y7XoypvQRhY).
