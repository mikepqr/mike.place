A couple of years ago, I was the lead author on [a report about Federated
learning](https://federated.fastforwardlabs.com/).

Federated learning is a family of algorithms for doing distributed machine
learning without moving the training data between machines. This can reduce the
bandwidth and power requirements, and it helps to preserve the privacy of the
data.

[The report](https://federated.fastforwardlabs.com/) goes into all this in much
more detail. It will take you about an hour to read. 

It used to be behind a paywall, available only to clients of [Fast Forward
Labs](https://www.cloudera.com/products/fast-forward-labs-research.html) (once a
startup, now a part of Cloudera). But it was recently made public, so I hope
you'll check it out!

If you'd rather watch a talk about federated learning, then [I gave one at
Strange Loop in 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUINeZUAlx8)
([slides](https://mike.place/talks/fl/)).

If you'd rather listen to a podcast, then [I spoke with the wonderful Jeffrey
Meyerson on Software Engineering
Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/10/23/federated-learning-with-mike-lee-williams/).

And if you'd rather play a slightly weird federated learning game then check out
[Turbofan Tycoon](https://turbofan.fastforwardlabs.com/), the prototype I built
with [Grant Custer](https://twitter.com/grantcuster)!
