O'Reilly just published my [Oriole about
Keras](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/getting-started-with-deep-learning-using-keras-and-python/purchase).

[Keras](http://keras.io/) is a high-level neural network library that, among
many other things, wraps an API similar to scikit-learn's around the Theano or
TensorFlow backends.

And what's an Oriole? It's part dockerized jupyter notebook, part web
application, and part video class. It allows the user to execute code without
installing the tools locally (which is kind of a big deal with Keras's
non-trivial dependencies), read embedded rich text inline remarks, and listen
to/watch a video of a high-level explanation.

My Keras Oriole is not free, but:

 - if you're interested in the Oriole idea then check out [Peter Norvig's on
 regex golf](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/regex-golf-with-peter-norvig).

 - if you're interested in Keras then you can read essentially [the same
 notebook on Github](https://github.com/fastforwardlabs/keras-hello-world/blob/master/kerashelloworld.ipynb), but you'll have to install Keras locally to run it, and
 you're missing out on me floating at the top of your screen making bad jokes.
