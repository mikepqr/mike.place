This article is an edited version of a talk I gave at PyBay 2018. As such, it's
loooong (sorry) and you may prefer to <a

If you've heard of serverless, you probably know it as a cloud architecture
that minimizes the amount of long-lived infrastructure required by an
application. In some situations this can reduce costs. That's true, and
relevant background, but this article will introduce you to its application in
a new context: embarrassingly parallel function application and production
machine learning.

If you're a data scientist, you may not yet know much about serverless.
This article will start off by introducing you to its most prominent use case:
web operations. But as you'll see, if you're constrained by your computing
resources, serverless is a lightweight alternative to setting up something
like a Spark cluster (or waiting for someone else to set one up). It's also a
relatively easy way to throw a simple model into production, without support
from ops.

## The argument for serverless

Most data scientists aren't interested in operations, but it's a great context
in which to demonstrate what makes serverless unusual, so bear with me.

It's generally agreed that computers were a bad idea.

![Computers are bad. Put them in the
trash.](https://mike.place/talks/serverless/slides/slides.003.jpeg)

One of the wonderful things about the cloud is that the hardware is somebody
else's problem. You're paying Amazon or Google or Microsoft to deal with it.
They do a really good job, to the extent that you can largely forget about the
hardware.

But moving to the cloud comes with costs. One of those costs is literal money.
That's partly because, despite the fact that we associate the cloud with the
ability to scale dynamically, inevitably we end up paying for underutilized,
long-lived resources.

And although the cloud successfully abstracts away the hardware, we still need
to install, configure, secure, and maintain the operating system or database or
whatever. This is a shame because for many of us it's not what we want to do
with our time. And for most of our employers, it's not how they make money.
They make money by deploying business logic.

![Computers are bad. Put them in the
trash.](https://mike.place/talks/serverless/slides/slides.006.jpeg)

So what if we could not only get rid of our physical infrastructure, but also
the next layer up: the operating system or container? If we could do that
then we could focus entirely on the business logic.

That is the goal of serverless.

## What _is_ serverless?

Consider a simple serverless deployment of an application that adds two numbers.
First, a request comes in to some kind of gateway service. In this case the
request is `2 + 2`. In effect, the gateway service summons a machine out of
thin air (ðŸ’¥) and deploys the application on that machine. The new machine
figures out the response, sends it back, and then ceases to exist (ðŸ’¥).

Then another request (`35 + 7`) arrives, and the same thing happens: the gateway
creates a completely new machine (it doesn't resurrect the machine used to
respond to the last instance), which performs the calculation and then ceases to
exist. Crucially, in the time between these two requests, the owner of this
adding application has no infrastructure. 

![Serverless adding application](https://mike.place/talks/serverless/slides/slides.007.jpeg)

More generally, you could say the amount of infrastructure scales almost
linearly with utilization, and that linear relationship has an intercept of
zero! (This is very important for understanding the situations in which
serverless is cheap.)

This description captures what makes this approach unusual. It also elides and
indeed mangles a bunch of engineering details that, as beginning _users_ of
serverless, we are largely able to ignore.

By the way, "serverless" is a really bad name, because you still have servers.
In fact, you effectively have infinitely many of them. (In that sense, it's a
bit like "nonparametric statistics," which is "nonparametric" in the sense that
you have, well, lots of parameters, rather than in the usual sense of
"non," which is that that you have, well, none.)

## Serverless deployment with AWS Lambda and Zappa

Generally, in order to derive the maximum benefits of serverless (i.e., making
the operations problems somebody else's), you need to give money to one of the
big cloud providers to use its serverless platforms. Your options include AWS
Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions. These services create,
destroy, and otherwise manage a very large pool of short-lived machines (like
the ones we used to calculate `2 + 2` and `35 + 7` above).

To demonstrate deployment on AWS Lambda, let's use the example of a simple
Python Flask application that tells the user the time: 

```python
# app.py
import datetime
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/time")
def time():
    return str(datetime.datetime.now())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

If you haven't seen Flask before, there's some boilerplate, but the important
thing is the `time` function (which returns the time) and the line immediately
before it, which is a _decorator_. That decorator tells Flask that if someone
visits the path `/time`, it should respond with the result of the function.

You can "deploy" this app locally by running `python app.py`:

```markdown
$ python app.py
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

And if you visit `127.0.0.1:5000/time` you can get the time:

```markdown
$ curl 127.0.0.1:5000/time
2019-05-09 21:09:46.450550
```

But if your laptop is firewalled sensibly and you have aspirations to
occasionally put it to sleep, this is not a good place for this app to live
in the long term. Let's deploy it to AWS Lambda.

There's a lot of fiddly bookkeeping involved in this, but the good news is you
can avoid it all by using one of a number of command-line tools. I recommend 
[Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa). I like Zappa because it's written
in Python, and at least in principle it's agnostic about which of the
serverless platforms you deploy to. The other options I know about are the
confusingly named [Serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) and
AWS's [Chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalice/).

Here's how you use Zappa to deploy the time app. First you create and 
activate a fresh virtual environment, and install your dependencies
into that virtualenv. In this case that's Flask and Zappa. Copy
`app.py` from above into the same directory, then run `zappa init`:

```markdown
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask zappa
zappa init
```

`zappa init` will prompt you to answer a few questions. In this simple case you
can accept the defaults. That creates a configuration file that looks something
like this:

```markdown
$ cat zappa_settings.json
{
    "dev": {
        "app_function": "app.app",
        "aws_region": "us-east-1",
        "profile_name": "default",
        "project_name": "basic",
        "runtime": "python3.6",
        "s3_bucket": "zappa-ycr5dtiyk"
    }
}
```

Then you do `zappa deploy`, and this is where Zappa shines:

```markdown

```

It's taking care of a huge amount of fiddly stuff here. Most notably, it's
creating a zip file that contains both the application and its dependencies (as
defined by what it finds installed in the virtual environment), and copying
that to AWS. At the end of all the bookkeeping, you get a public URL you can use
and share to replace localhost. 

That URL no longer works (because I ran `zappa undeploy`), but trust me, it
used to do this:

```markdown
$ curl https://ucyxlhvz7f.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/time
2019-05-10 04:30:59.270893
```

In broad strokes, this is what happens in response to the request for that URL:

 - A computer is summoned out of thin air.
 - The application and dependencies uploaded with Zappa are deployed to
   that new computer.
 - The new computer receives the request.
 - The response is computed and returned.
 - The computer is destroyed.

This same thing happens every time someone visits the URL.
(In practice, AWS does some caching of the instances to keep things responsive,
but conceptually a fresh instance is created and promptly destroyed for each
request.)

Crucially, this rather complicated procedure means that your app is in
production, publicly accessible, and you're paying exactly zero dollars for it
while it's not in use.

I've put all the code for this article in [a GitHub
repository](https://github.com/williamsmj/serverless-for-data-scientists). In
there I also show how to upgrade this deployed application to allow the
time zone as a URL parameter. Zappa makes that upgrade easy (run `zappa
update`), and offers a handy `zappa tail` command that consolidates the logs and errors
from the components of the deployed application in your laptop terminal. This
makes debugging easier if you screw up the deployment or the running application
generates an exception (say, if a user supplies an invalid URL parameter). You
can even use serverless in general (and Zappa with AWS Lambda in particular) to
configure cron jobs to run on serverless executors. For an example of that, see
my [weather Twitter bot](https://github.com/williamsmj/dwx).

## The advantages and limitations of serverless

Commonly cited advantages of serverless are that it allows you to focus on
business logic, and you get infinite scalability built in at deployment. On the
other hand, some would argue that serverless shares disadvantages with
microservice architectures (e.g., complexity) and with cloud deployments (e.g.,
risk of vendor lock-in). The extent to which any individual engineer buys these
claims varies, and they aren't terribly relevant to the data science bit of
this article (which I'm getting to!), so I won't dwell on them.

One claimed benefit of serverless that is salient to the data science use case is cost:
because we only pay when our code is running, and we pay in direct proportion
to its usage with no unutilized overheads, it's often cheap! For example,
Postlight's Readability API cost them about $10,000/month on EC2. They [moved
it over to AWS
Lambda](https://postlight.com/trackchanges/serving-39-million-requests-for-370-month-or-how-we-reduced-our-hosting-costs-by-two-orders-of)
and now it costs $370/month.

![Cost plot](/post/serverless/costplot.png)

But it's true to say serverless _can_ be very expensive. Consider the (very
schematic!) plot above. The cost of serverless scales linearly with utilization
and has an intercept of zero. Generally, this is cheaper than the alternatives
for small-scale deployments. And it may be cheaper for situations where compute
usage is very bursty. But if you're serving thousands of requests a second,
you're likely to be up in the region of the graph where the lines have long
since crossed, and a non-serverless approach would be cheaper.

Perhaps the most fundamental difference between serverless and more traditional
deployment patterns -- and this is not so much a disadvantage as a set of
restrictions inherent in serverless -- is the nature of these machines that pop
in and out of existence. I've been very vague about them so far. In part that's
because I'm honestly kind of sketchy about how they work. But let me tell you
what I do know.

![Underpowered and
short-lived](https://mike.place/talks/serverless/slides/slides.021.jpeg)

These are underpowered machines. In the case of [AWS
Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html), at the time
of writing, they have no more than 3 GB of RAM and a relatively small amount of
local storage (75 GB). And they are living on borrowed time. Your function must
complete in 15 minutes. Those limitations are kind of arbitrary, and they
change rapidly (not long ago Lambda limited you to 1.5 GB, 500 MB, and 300
seconds!).

But the unavoidable restriction, which is inherent in the premise of serverless
and will not change, is that these short-lived machines have no state. They
have no record of previous instances. They even have no direct way of
communicating with other running serverless instances. So, side effects like
posting to Twitter or writing to a database aside, these serverless instances
only support _pure_ functions that take input and return a value. No global
state.

Honestly, at this point you're probably thinking: wow, serverless sounds
_terrible_. Stick with me.

## Mapping functions over arguments with AWS Lambda and Pywren

So! We've got these machines that:

 - Have no internal state.
 - Are not very fast.

But!
 
 - We've got a lot of them
 - And we only pay for them while we're using them.

This raises interesting possibilities for data scientists! The rest of this
article is about those possibilities, and a proof of concept tool called
[Pywren](http://pywren.io/) that was first described in ["Occupy the Cloud:
Distributed Computing for the 99%"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04024). Even if
you haven't read a CS paper before (or for a while), I highly recommend that
link (or [the Morning Paper
commentary](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/10/30/occupy-the-cloud-distributed-computing-for-the-99/)).

Here's a picture of data science to indicate that we're moving into a new part
of this article.

![Data science!](/post/serverless/datascience.jpg)

Pywren is a tool that maps functions across arguments using
Lambda as the computational backend. What does "map functions across arguments"
mean? In Python 2, simply this:

```python
>>> def square(x):
...     return x * x

>>> args = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 36]

>>> map(square, args)
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
```

The `map` function takes another function (`square` in this case) and a list of
arguments to apply it to, and returns a list of the results of those
applications. In Python 3 this ends up being a bit more verbose because `map`
now evaluates lazily (i.e., returns a generator that you can consume immediately
or later). If this distinction is lost on you, don't worry about it
(although do worry about the fact that Python 2 support will be ending at the end of
2019!)

`map` is probably familiar to you if you're a JS or Haskell programmer (among
other languages). But if you're a Python programmer, then you may not recognize
this function at all. The more Pythonic approach is a list
comprehension, which is superficially different, but fundamentally the same
idea:

```python
>>> [square(x) for x in args]
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
```

Pywren provides an (almost) drop-in replacement for Python's built-in `map`
function that uses a separate AWS Lambda instance for each application of the
function to an argument, instead of your local machine. Here's the syntax:

```
>>> import pywren

>>> pwex = pywren.default_executor()

>>> futures = pwex.map(square, args)

>>> futures
[<pywren.future.ResponseFuture at 0x11422ffd0>,
 <pywren.future.ResponseFuture at 0x11422f588>,
 <pywren.future.ResponseFuture at 0x11422f358>,
 <pywren.future.ResponseFuture at 0x11422f748>,
 <pywren.future.ResponseFuture at 0x10bbfff98>,
 <pywren.future.ResponseFuture at 0x11422f470>]

>>> futures[0].result()
0

>>> [f.result() for f in futures]
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
```

It's not _quite_ a drop-in replacement for `map`, because it returns a list of
`futures` objects rather than the results. But you can trivially get the
results from those futures.

![Pywren execution](/post/serverless/pywren.png)

What's actually going on when we use Pywren? Here's my understanding:

 1. Pywren serializes the function and puts it on S3, and invokes the Lambdas
    ("host submit" in the graph above).
 2. The Lambdas start (that's "task start").
 3. They have to do some setup, which involves pulling and deserializing the
    job from S3 and installing an Anaconda Python runtime (that's "setup done").
 4. They compute the result and write it to S3 ("task done"), where it waits for
    us to call the `result` method.
 5. When we call that method, we download the result to our client ("result
    returned").

Note, by the way, the scale on the x-axis here. Yes, we're doing a bunch of
stuff in parallel, but the overhead (around 20 seconds!) is enormous relative
to the task. We'll come back to this.

## Embarrassingly parallel computation and carrots

The `square` function is a candidate for Pywren because it is
_embarrassingly parallel_. What does that mean?

Imagine a field of carrots. There are 8 rows, each containing 10 carrots. You have a
harvester that can pick 1 carrot per second. It's going to take 80 seconds to
harvest the carrots.

<pre>

What if you have 2 harvesters? They can work independently and harvest the
carrots in half the time.

You get a speedup in direct proportion to the number of workers because the
tractors can work independently. This is not like co-authoring a book, where
the two authors need to exchange information regularly about what they've done
so far. The tractors are truly independent. There is no inter-worker
communication. That's embarrassingly parallel.

Anything in Python that you'd normally implement as a list comprehension
usually has this characteristic. Some `for` loops have side effects and are not
embarrassingly parallel, but if you can convert a `for` loop to a comprehension,
it's likely embarrassingly parallel too.

## Embarrassingly parallel Pywren examples

Now, squaring the first six numbers is cool, but what about some real work?
Here are a few examples.

### 1. Web scraping

I wanted to scrape the abstracts for the many thousands of machine learning
papers from a conference website. Doing this on my laptop took a long time
because I was scraping them one at a time. I could have sped the process up by
parallelizing the task across my CPU's cores, but I would still have been
constrained by the speed of my internet connection.

By shifting this map to Lambda with Pywren, I could work in parallel 
// RH: I was able to work in parallel?
and also
benefit from AWS's faster internet connection! The code looks roughly like
this:

```python
>>> def scrape_batch(batch):
...    for paper in batch:
...        paper["abstract"] = scrape_abstract_for_one_paper(paper)
...    return batch

>>> batches = [[paper1, paper2, ...], [paper101, paper201, ...], ...]

>>> pywren.get_all_results(pwex.map(scrape_batch, batches))
```

In this case I'm not mapping a function that scrapes one paper over a list of
papers. Rather, I'm mapping a function that scrapes a batch of papers over a
list of batches. I'm doing that because scraping one paper is relatively quick,
which means that if I map them one at a time then the overhead of setting up
Lambda instances dominates. By accumulating lots of pages until that 20-second
overhead is worth it, I maximize my speedup.

The above is pseudocode. The full code (and the resulting dataset) is [on
GitHub](github.com/williamsmj/nips.json) if you're interested.

### 2. The Black-Scholes equation

The Black-Scholes equation is a partial differential equation that describes
the evolution of a stock option. Bradford Lynch wanted to [solve it for many
millions of
configurations](http://www.bradfordlynch.com/blog/2017/05/28/ComputeOnLambda.html).
Each solution is a pretty beefy numerical computation taking several tens of
seconds. Without parallelization, the task would have taken 3 days on a single
machine. On AWS Lambda using Pywren, it took 16 minutes.

### 3. Video encoding

Certain parts of video encoding algorithms are embarrassingly parallel because
they're performed one frame at a time. ["Encoding, Fast and Slow: Low-Latency
Video Processing Using Thousands of Tiny
Threads"](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi17/technical-sessions/presentation/fouladi)
describes the application of an approach similar to Pywren's to this problem.

This work is interesting because there's a very significant speed threshold in
video encoding: can you encode faster than 24 (or 60) frames per second? Beyond
this, you're in the realm of real-time video encoding, which opens up new kinds
of use cases. It's also interesting because, unlike Pywren, this approach doesn't 
do a single Lambda submission for a single batch of tasks; the authors
orchestrated a long-lived pipeline for ongoing video. Serverless for data
engineering!

### 4. Hyperparameter optimization

In general, machine learning algorithms are a little tricky to parallelize.
Distributed gradient descent, for example, is a famously subtle algorithmic
problem, even before you get to the question of the system you're distributing
over.

But one part of the ML workflow that's a good fit for Pywren out of the box is
hyperparameter optimization.

![Training data](/post/serverless/trainingdata.png)

Suppose we have some training data, with two classes (yellow and purple)
and two features. We can train a model for this data locally using `scikit-learn`.
(This is a toy problem to illustrate the idea. Don't get hung up on the sloppy
validation in this section; imagine a bigger problem!)

```python
>>> from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

>>> classifier = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

>>> classifier.fit(Xtrain, ytrain)

>>> classifier.score(Xtest, ytest)
0.838
```

Here, `n_neighbors` is a "hyperparameter" -- a magic number required by an ML
algorithm that you have to choose on a problem-by-problem basis. In this case,
we need to choose how many nearby training samples are going to get to vote on
the classification of our new point.

The usual way to do this is a simple search: we try all the possibilities, and
pick the one that gives the most accurate model. This is embarrassingly
parallel, so we can use Pywren! We need a list of the values of `n_neighbors`
we want to test and a function that returns a trained model to map over the
list:

```python
>>> all_hyperparams
[{'n_neighbors': 1},
 {'n_neighbors': 2},
 {'n_neighbors': 3},
 {'n_neighbors': 4},
 {'n_neighbors': 5},
 {'n_neighbors': 6},
 {'n_neighbors': 7},
 {'n_neighbors': 8}]

>>> def train_model(hyperparams):
...    classifier = KNeighborsClassifier(**hyperparams)
...    classifier.fit(Xtrain, ytrain)
...    return classifier
```

Now we can send this computation off to AWS Lambda:

```python
>>> futures = pwex.map(train_model, all_hyperparams)

>>> classifiers = pywren.get_all_results(futures)

>>> for hyperparams, classifier in zip(all_hyperparams, classifiers):
...    print(hyperparams, classifier.score(Xtest, ytest))

{'n_neighbors': 1} 0.758
{'n_neighbors': 2} 0.782
{'n_neighbors': 3} 0.814
{'n_neighbors': 4} 0.82
{'n_neighbors': 5} 0.838
{'n_neighbors': 6} 0.838
{'n_neighbors': 7} 0.842
{'n_neighbors': 8} 0.828
```

Note that Pywren doesn't only send back simple results like numbers. It can
send back a rich Python object with attributes and methods (in this case,
trained `scikit-learn` classifiers). This allows us to compute the accuracy of
each model using a local test set and choose the best one, all from the comfort of
our laptop.

## Serverless for machine learning operations

Suppose we serialize the best model (`n_neighbors = 7`, apparently) and upload
it to a public S3 bucket. That allows us to do our final trick!

Remember Zappa, the CLI I demoed right at the start of this article that 
allows us to deploy Flask applications? If you use Zappa to deploy this Flask
application, you've got machine learning in production!

```python
url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/modelservingdemo/classifier.pkl"
r = requests.get(url)
classifier = pickle.loads(r.content)

@app.route("/predict")
def predict():
    X = [[float(request.args['feature_1']),
          float(request.args['feature_2'])]]
    label = classifier.predict(X)
    if label == 0:
        return "purple blob"
    else:
        return "yellow blob"
```

If you don't believe me, visit [the deployed
application](https://cpj4teujk3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/predict?feature_1=9&feature_2=6)
and change the URL parameters.

There is [a whole startup](https://algorithmia.com/) based around the specific
idea of putting machine learning into production using a serverless foundation in
this way. I'm assuming their approach is somewhat more robust and complex than
the dozen lines of Python above!

## Some more limitations

Earlier we touched on some general engineering criticisms of serverless
(complexity, lock-in, cost) and its limitations (no state,
limited RAM and lifetime).

Before I conclude, I want to add to those lists in the specific context of
data science.

First let's address a couple of prosaic limitations to the specs of Lambda
instances. If the individual function applications take longer than 900
seconds, AWS Lambda can't help unless you break them into smaller atomic tasks.
This can be tricky. And Lambda instances don't have GPUs. This limits their
utility for deep learning.

Second, let's talk a little more deeply about algorithms. Pywren really only
works for embarrassingly parallel problems. Some MapReduce work is
embarrassingly parallel, but most has a shuffle step, where the results are
aggregated and manipulated and potentially distributed back out for further
work. The [Pywren team](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04024) and
[others](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi17/technical-sessions/presentation/fouladi)
have demonstrated workarounds that involve writing intermediate results to S3.
But at that point Pywren is no longer a drop-in replacement for the Python
`map` function. You need to think more carefully about the structure of the
algorithm you're attempting to parallelize.

Luckily, in the case of linear algebra, the Pywren team have done some of that
work for us by releasing [`numpywren`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09679)! This is
what it sounds like: a linear algebra library that is, from the point of view
of the user, very similar to `numpy`. On the backend it uses AWS Lambda to
perform the computations, but it goes beyond Pywren by handling the orchestration
and communication required to apply the fastest algorithms to linear algebra on
serverless.

## Conclusion

So, you've seen that serverless is good for deploying websites and running cron
jobs. And you saw at length that it's good for a certain kind of computation,
namely embarrassingly parallel stuff. You can even imagine a workflow that
combines these ideas: [running hyperparameter optimization on AWS Lambda using
Pywren](#4-hyperparameter-optimization), and then [deploying the best model to
AWS Lambda using Zappa](serverless-for-machine-learning-operations). Serverless
is good for these things in the sense that it's relatively easy to set up and
cheap to use.

The reason it's cheap (and the high-level principle to take away from this
article) is what those applications have in common: they're bursty. They
sometimes require significant resources that Lambda can scale up to
accommodate, but they sometimes require zero or almost zero resources. Your web
product is new, your cron job isn't on, or you're working interactively and
you're now staring at your notebook trying to figure out what the results mean.
On serverless, you're not paying for that time.

So: the best thing about serverless is not so much that it's great when you're
using it (although the ability to scale up is powerful), but that it's great
when you're _not_ using it!

Remember the Pywren paper was called ["Distributed Computing for the
99%"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04024)? The data science 1% operate in
organizations that do data science at a scale where they always require some
(if not most) of their computing resources. Global consumption varies, but it
doesn't go down to zero. Or if it does, peak usage is so high that's it's
cheaper to just buy the dang cluster. And the data scientists have data
engineering, tools and operations support to take care of those long-lived
resources. Serverless in the sense described in this article is not for those
data scientists.

But if you're operating independently, and you don't have the money, the
engineering support, or the patience for heavyweight solutions, take a look at
zappa, pywren and the serverless ecosystem.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
